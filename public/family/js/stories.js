      <h5>Troubled Teenage and Young Adult Years</h5>
      <p>During his teenage years, Roland faced significant challenges, including a serious altercation with a neighbor that led to threats of murder. In response, his mother Lydia banished him to Bataan to live with his grandmother, Lucina, where he completed his high school education.</p>
      <p>For his college education, Roland enrolled at the University of the East - Caloocan, initially pursuing Mechanical Engineering. However, his grades were poor, filled with failures. After a serious conversation with his mother, he resolved to improve himself by shifting his focus to Accountancy. His dedication paid off as his academic performance greatly improved, culminating in passing the national board examination to become a Certified Public Accountant in the Philippines.</p>

      <h5>Against All Odds: Survival of the Death March During World War II</h5>
      <p>Fernando's story is one of courage and resilience amidst the harrowing backdrop of World War II in the Philippines. Born on May 30, 1916, he fought bravely in the Battle of Bataan and survived the infamous Death March by ingeniously concealing himself in "nitchos" or death beds within a cemetery in Hermosa, Bataan. His quick thinking and bold moves were crucial to his survival during one of the darkest periods in Philippine history.</p>

      <p>Fernando welcomed his eldest son, Bonifacio Saplala, around 1939. His second son, Claro Saplala, was born right after. Had Fernando not successfully evaded death during the March, the story of his family would have been starkly different. His return from the brink of death enabled him to continue his lineage, leading to the birth of his two daughters: Lydia Saplala on November 24, 1944; and Celia Saplala on March 2, 1946. Unfortunately, Fernando passed away on May 3, 1993, leaving behind a legacy of bravery and the enduring spirit of survival.</p>
