      <h5>Troubled Teenage and Young Adult Years</h5>
      <p>During his teenage years, Roland faced significant challenges, including a serious altercation with a neighbor that led to threats of murder. In response, his mother Lydia banished him to Bataan to live with his grandmother, Lucina, where he completed his high school education.</p>
      <p>For his college education, Roland enrolled at the University of the East - Caloocan, initially pursuing Mechanical Engineering. However, his grades were poor, filled with failures. After a serious conversation with his mother, he resolved to improve himself by shifting his focus to Accountancy. His dedication paid off as his academic performance greatly improved, culminating in passing the national board examination to become a Certified Public Accountant in the Philippines.</p>

      <h5>Against All Odds</h5>
      <p>Fernando's story is one of courage and resilience amidst the harrowing backdrop of World War II in the Philippines. Born on May 30, 1916, he fought bravely in the Battle of Bataan and survived the infamous Death March by ingeniously concealing himself in "nitchos" or death beds within a cemetery in Hermosa, Bataan. His quick thinking and bold moves were crucial to his survival during one of the darkest periods in Philippine history.</p>

        <p class="caption"><em>Prisoners of war on the Bataan Death March. (Photo owned by the U.S. Air Force)</em></p>
      </figure>
      <p>Fernando welcomed his eldest son, Bonifacio Saplala, around 1939. His second son, Claro Saplala, was born right after. Had Fernando not successfully evaded death during the March, the story of his family would have been starkly different. His return from the brink of death enabled him to continue his lineage, leading to the birth of his two daughters: Lydia Saplala on November 24, 1944; and Celia Saplala on March 2, 1946. Unfortunately, Fernando passed away on May 3, 1993, leaving behind a legacy of bravery and the enduring spirit of survival.</p>

      <h5>Coming to Caloocan</h5>
      <p>According to Lydia Saplala, Fernando’s eldest daughter, the journey to Caloocan began with Fernando's various military assignments. As a soldier, Fernando was often stationed in different locations, one of which was Caloocan. During their time there, the family learned that the local government was offering parcels of land to soldiers, provided they could afford the down payment. Seeing an opportunity, Lydia's husband, Marcial, stepped in and paid the down payment. This pivotal moment allowed the family to secure a piece of land in Caloocan, where they would eventually settle and build their lives.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing <time datetime="2024-08-10 16:21:48">(August 11, 2024 PHT)</time>, only his grandson Claro Saplala Jr. and his family lives here. The house has also undergone multiple renovations already.</p>

      <h5>Orphaned at a Very Young Age</h5>
      <p>When Babycor (shorthand for "Baby Corazon") was still three years old, her mother, Catalina Maramba, passed away because of an illness. Although her father, Manuel Acosta Jr., was still alive he wasn't always present because he worked as a Seaman.</p>

      <p>Three months after Babycor turned eight years old, her father died as well. According to Manuel Acosta III, Corazon's older brother, they were taken care for mostly by their grandparents: Manuel Acosta Sr. and Natividad San Agustin, and also their aunt: Vicky Acosta.</p>

      <h5>90s Gamer Girl</h5>
      <p>According to Darwin Acosta, Corazon's first cousin and youngest son of Benjamin Acosta Sr., Corazon was actually a great player of the original "Super Mario Bros." game. Without the advent of Social Media like what we have today, she discovered that she can gain unlimited lives in the game by doing what we now know as "Turtle Tipping"</p>

      <h5>Spent <strong>₱0</strong> for College</h5>
      <p>It's probably not zero, but Corazon Acosta spent close to nothing when she studied Accountancy in the University of the East - Caloocan. Embarrassed and ashamed to accept money from her aunt: Amelia Acosta, she entered UE's Student Assistant program which acts as a "working student" type of scholarship.</p>
      <p>The minimum requirement is you do the job required by what department you are assigned to and you don't get any failing grade. In turn, you will receive a small stipend and a full scholarship for that semester. Because of her hardwork and dedication, she actually graduated a semester earlier than expected and have spent nothing on school tuition.</p>

      <p>Back when Mitchie was still in college, she participated in <strong>a lot</strong> of extra-curricular activities. Sometimes ignoring more "practical" choices 😅 The very first official position that she ran for was the Public-relations Officer of the Engineering Student Council. She was in office from school year (S.Y.) 2013 to 2014.</p>
      <p>After experiencing handling a student government position, she took on higher and more positions in more specific recognized student organizations (RSO). She also won awards for participating in internal and inter-school competitions.</p>
