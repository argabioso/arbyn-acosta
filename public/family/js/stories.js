        <h5>Against All Odds: Survival of the Death March During World War II</h5>
        <p>Lolo Andong's story is one of courage and resilience amidst the harrowing backdrop of World War II in the Philippines. Born on May 30, 1916, he fought bravely in the Battle of Bataan and survived the infamous <strong>Death March</strong> by ingeniously concealing himself in "nitchos" or death beds within a cemetery in Hermosa, Bataan. His quick thinking and bold moves were crucial to his survival during one of the darkest periods in Philippine history.</p>

        <p>Lolo Andong welcomed his eldest son, Bonifacio Saplala, around 1939. His second son, Claro Saplala, was born right after. Had Lolo Andong not successfully evaded death during the March, the story of his family would have been starkly different. His return from the brink of death enabled him to continue his lineage, leading to the birth of his two daughters: Lydia Saplala on November 24, 1944; and Celia Saplala on March 2, 1946. Unfortunately, Lolo Andong passed away on May 3, 1993, leaving behind a legacy of bravery and the enduring spirit of survival.</p>
