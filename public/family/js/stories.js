      <h5>Y-DNA Haplogroup</h5>
      <p>Arbyn's haplogroup is <strong>P-FT346</strong>. A "haplogroup" is like a big family tree for your DNA. It shows how groups of people are related to each other over thousands of years.</p>
      <p>Y-DNA comes from the Y chromosome which is passed from father to son remaining mostly unaltered across generations. Given this, you can imagine "Y-DNA Haplogroup" as a line from man, to his father, to his paternal grandfather, to his paternal great-grandfather, and so on.</p>
      <figure class="no-border">

        <p class="caption"><em>Arbyn's haplogroup timeline generated by FamilyTreeDNA.</em></p>
      </figure>
      <p><strong>P-FT346</strong> paternal line was formed when it branched off from the ancestor <strong>P-BY49600</strong> and the rest of mankind around <strong>21,000 BCE</strong>. The man who is the most recent common ancestor of this line is estimated to have been born around <strong>1100 BCE</strong>.</p>

      <h5>Cinematic Proposal</h5>
      <p>For Arbyn's proposal to Mitchie, the plan was to show a custom video on the big screen after viewing a movie together. Arbyn booked one of the cinemas in the Director's Club of SM City Grand Central for over P20,000 on April 23, 2023 (8:30 PM).</p>
      <p>The chosen movie was The Super Mario Brothers Movie because Arbyn believed it would appeal to anyone who watches it and, generally speaking, everyone is most likely familiar with Mario.</p>

      <h5>Troubled Teenage and Young Adult Years</h5>
      <p>During his teenage years, Roland faced significant challenges, including a serious altercation with a neighbor that led to threats of murder. In response, his mother Lydia banished him to Bataan to live with his grandmother, Lucina, where he completed his high school education.</p>
      <p>For his college education, Roland enrolled at the University of the East - Caloocan, initially pursuing Mechanical Engineering. However, his grades were poor, filled with failures. After a serious conversation with his mother, he resolved to improve himself by shifting his focus to Accountancy. His dedication paid off as his academic performance greatly improved, culminating in passing the national board examination to become a Certified Public Accountant in the Philippines.</p>

      <h5>Aftermath of Duterte's Administration</h5>
      <p>In 2016, following the election of President Rodrigo Duterte, Roland faced an abrupt turning point in his career. Due to the high-ranking nature of his role as Deputy Director in the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)—a position requiring presidential appointment—Roland was removed from office as part of a broader administrative reshuffle.</p>
      <p>Undeterred by this unexpected challenge, Roland quickly transitioned to the private sector. In 2017, he joined the International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICTSI) as the Asia Pacific Department Manager, overseeing crucial operations and leveraging his leadership experience in a new domain. This career shift marked another chapter of resilience and adaptability in Roland’s inspiring professional journey.</p>

      <h5>Against All Odds</h5>
      <p>Fernando's story is one of courage and resilience amidst the harrowing backdrop of World War II in the Philippines. Born on May 30, 1916, he fought bravely in the Battle of Bataan and survived the infamous Death March by ingeniously concealing himself in "nitchos" or death beds within a cemetery in Hermosa, Bataan. His quick thinking and bold moves were crucial to his survival during one of the darkest periods in Philippine history.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Fernando welcomed his eldest son, Bonifacio Saplala, around 1939. His second son, Claro Saplala, was born right after. Had Fernando not successfully evaded death during the March, the story of his family would have been starkly different. His return from the brink of death enabled him to continue his lineage, leading to the birth of his two daughters: Lydia Saplala on November 24, 1944; and Celia Saplala on March 2, 1946. Unfortunately, Fernando passed away on May 3, 1993, leaving behind a legacy of bravery and the enduring spirit of survival.</p>

      <h5>Coming to Caloocan</h5>
      <p>According to Lydia Saplala, Fernando’s eldest daughter, the journey to Caloocan began with Fernando's various military assignments. As a soldier, Fernando was often stationed in different locations, one of which was Caloocan. During their time there, the family learned that the local government was offering parcels of land to soldiers, provided they could afford the down payment. Seeing an opportunity, Lydia's husband, Marcial, stepped in and paid the down payment. This pivotal moment allowed the family to secure a piece of land in Caloocan, where they would eventually settle and build their lives.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing <time datetime="2024-08-10 16:21:48">(August 11, 2024 PHT)</time>, only his grandson Claro Saplala Jr. and his family lives here. The house has also undergone multiple renovations already.</p>

      <h5>Orphaned at a Very Young Age</h5>
      <p>When Babycor (shorthand for "Baby Corazon") was still three years old, her mother, Catalina Maramba, passed away because of an illness. Although her father, Manuel Acosta Jr., was still alive, he wasn't always present because he worked as a Seaman.</p>

      <h5>90s Gamer Girl</h5>
      <p>According to Darwin Acosta, Corazon's first cousin and the youngest son of Benjamin Acosta Sr., Corazon was a great player in the original "Super Mario Bros." game. Without the advent of social media like what we have today, she discovered that she could gain unlimited lives in the game by doing what we now know as "Turtle Tipping."</p>

      <h5>Spent <strong>₱0</strong> for College</h5>
      <p>Corazon Acosta spent nearly nothing when she studied Accountancy at the University of the East - Caloocan. Embarrassed and ashamed to accept money from her aunt, Amelia Acosta, she entered UE's Student Assistant program that provides a "working student" scholarship.</p>
      <p>The program required her to fulfill departmental duties and maintain passing grades in exchange for a modest stipend and full tuition coverage for the semester. Through her dedication and hard work, Corazon graduated a semester earlier than expected and has spent almost nothing on school tuition.</p>

      <h5>Cause of Death</h5>
      <p>It was never verified medically how Corazon died. The assumption is that it's a collection of conditions that ultimately resulted in her death.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Chronic stress</strong>. Around the time before Corazon died, there were disputes and fights regarding the ownership of their family house and land in Caloocan. This was between her, her sister, her nephew, and their aunt.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Perimenopause</strong>. It was believed that Corazon was going through Perimenopause which caused her heavy periods which might've caused the next condition.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Iron-deficiency Anemia</strong>. Her family in Laguna stated that she was taking iron supplements for this condition. During the same time, she was experiencing anemia rashes around her body.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Mentality</strong>. Corazon was known to go to hospitals as a last resort. Because of this, while she was experiencing all the conditions stated before, she didn't seek out medical professional opinion until the last minute.</p></li>

      <h5>Family Line During Mitch's Childhood</h5>
      <p>Mitchie was lucky enough to see one of her maternal great-grandmothers, Enoria Borja. It gets even better because her parents were able to take and preserve a photo of them together. The photo was taken when Mitchie was around two or three years old.</p>

      <h5>Extra-curricular Super Star</h5>
      <p>While in college, Mitchie was actively involved in numerous extracurricular activities.

      <p>For Mitchie's proposal from Arbyn, it came as a surprise but there were some clues all throughout the day that Mitchie told Arbyn later on:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>While entering the cinema, Mitchie noticed her best friend, Donn Zarny Han, because of his usual black hoodie with a white print.</li>
        <li>During the movie, Mitchie noticed one of her friends, Isabel Buenaobra, because of her recognizable red cap.</li>
        <li>During the movie, there were scenes in which Bowser, the movie antagonist, would propose to Princess Peach. Mitchie took this as a sign and thought Arbyn was already proposing to her.</p</li>
