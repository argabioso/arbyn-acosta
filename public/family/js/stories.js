      <h5>Troubled Teenage and Young Adult Years</h5>
      <p>During his teenage years, Roland faced significant challenges, including a serious altercation with a neighbor that led to threats of murder. In response, his mother Lydia banished him to Bataan to live with his grandmother, Lucina, where he completed his high school education.</p>
      <p>For his college education, Roland enrolled at the University of the East - Caloocan, initially pursuing Mechanical Engineering. However, his grades were poor, filled with failures. After a serious conversation with his mother, he resolved to improve himself by shifting his focus to Accountancy. His dedication paid off as his academic performance greatly improved, culminating in passing the national board examination to become a Certified Public Accountant in the Philippines.</p>

      <h5>Against All Odds: Survival of the Death March During World War II </h5>
      <p>Fernando's story is one of courage and resilience amidst the harrowing backdrop of World War II in the Philippines. Born on May 30, 1916, he fought bravely in the Battle of Bataan and survived the infamous Death March by ingeniously concealing himself in "nitchos" or death beds within a cemetery in Hermosa, Bataan. His quick thinking and bold moves were crucial to his survival during one of the darkest periods in Philippine history.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Fernando welcomed his eldest son, Bonifacio Saplala, around 1939. His second son, Claro Saplala, was born right after. Had Fernando not successfully evaded death during the March, the story of his family would have been starkly different. His return from the brink of death enabled him to continue his lineage, leading to the birth of his two daughters: Lydia Saplala on November 24, 1944; and Celia Saplala on March 2, 1946. Unfortunately, Fernando passed away on May 3, 1993, leaving behind a legacy of bravery and the enduring spirit of survival.</p>

      <h5>Orphaned at a Very Young Age</h5>
      <p>When Babycor (shorthand for "Baby Corazon") was still three years old, her mother, Catalina Maramba, passed away because of an illness. Although her father, Manuel Acosta Jr., was still alive he wasn't always present because he worked as a Seaman.</p>

      <p class="caption"><em>Photo of Catalina Maramba with her three children: (from left to right) Susan Acosta, Corazon Acosta, and Manuel Acosta III.</em></p>
      <p>Three months after Babycor turned eight years old, her father died as well. According to Manuel Acosta III, Corazon's older brother, they were taken care for mostly by their grandparents: Manuel Acosta Sr. and Natividad San Agustin, and also their aunt: Vicky Acosta.</p>

      <p class="caption"><em>Photo of the Acosta Family swimming together. From left to right: Vicky Acosta, Manuel Acosta III, Natividad San Agustin, Benjamin Acosta Jr., Corazon Acosta, and Manuel Acosta Sr.</em></p>
      <p>Fortunately, specific only to Corazon though, she also grew up close to her step mother: Loren "Nene" Asis. Later, when Corazon was older, she also became the godmother of her younger step-sister Loremei Asis.</p>

      <h5>90s Gamer Girl</h5>
      <p>According to Darwin Acosta, Corazon's first cousin and youngest son of Benjamin Acosta Sr., Corazon was actually a great player of the original "Super Mario Bros." game. Without the advent of Social Media like what we have today, she discovered that she can gain unlimited lives in the game by doing what we now know as "Turtle Tipping"</p>

      <h5>Spent <strong>₱0</strong> for College</h5>
      <p>It's probably not zero, but Corazon Acosta spent close to nothing when she studied Accountancy in the University of the East - Caloocan. Embarrassed and ashamed to accept money from her aunt: Amelia Acosta, she entered UE's Student Assistant program which acts as a "working student" type of scholarship.</p>
      <p>The minimum requirement is you do the job required by what department you are assigned to and you don't get any failing grade. In turn, you will receive a small stipend and a full scholarship for that semester. Because of her hardwork and dedication, she actually graduated a semester earlier than expected and have spent nothing on school tuition.</p>
